I developed a NYT Connections style but a visual game as a web app. The challenge is to find the triple of a tree.  The player is presented with a grid of 9 jumbled up images of barks, buds and leaves of 3 trees (which are shown as clues). Their task is to identify the 3 triples (bark, bud, leaf) that are each connected to a single tree. They get 4 wrong attempts as well as utmost 3 hints.  One can develop their skills for identification of trees. 

Try this game on either desktop or a handheld device.
